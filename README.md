Once you have docker installed, and running in your local environment, you can clone this repository and start the docker containers

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ecasanova/recipes-challenge.git
$ cd recipes-challenge
$ docker compose up -d
```

Run this to load the database

```bash
$ cd backend
$ npm run loadrecipes
```

- If migrations don't work, sql file `data-backup.sql` is provided

# Usage

You can see the backend in: [http://127.0.0.1:3005/api](http://127.0.0.1:3005/api)

You can see the frontend in: [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

You can see redis commander in [http://127.0.0.1:8081/](http://127.0.0.1:8081/)

## Frontend

![frontend](screenshots/frontend.png)

It is possible to initialize the repository locally (The api service is required, it must be turned on)

```bash
$ cd frontend
$ npm run build && npm run start
```

## Backend (API)

![backend](screenshots/backend.png)

It is possible to initialize the repository locally (The database and the cache service are required, they must be activated)

```bash
$ cd backend
$ npm run start
```

## Docker Containers

![docker](screenshots/docker.png)

It is possible to start each container separately.

```bash
docker compose up recipes-api -d #recipes-api (NestJs)
docker compose up recipes-web -d #recipes-web (NextJs)
docker compose up recipes-db -d #recipes-db (PostgreSQL)
docker compose up recipes-cache -d #recipes-cache (Redis)
docker compose up redis-commander -d #redis-commander
```
